# THE PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE OF LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS


- One area where native client applications have an advantage over web applications is persistent local storage. The operating system typically provides an abstraction layer for storing and retrieving application-specific data such as preferences or runtime state for native applications. These values may be saved in the registry, INI files, XML files, or other locations.

- HTML5 storage is based on key/value pairs that are named. You store data using a named key, then retrieve it using the same key. The specified key is a string. Data types supported by JavaScript include strings, Booleans, integers, and floats. The data, however, is stored as a string.

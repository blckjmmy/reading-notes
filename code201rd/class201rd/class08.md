# HTML/CSS book, Ch. 15, “Layout” (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)
- Grid Layout excels(960.Grid System) at dividing a page into major regions or defining the relationship between parts of a control built from HTML primitives in terms of size, position, and layer. Grid layout, like tables, allows an author to align elements into columns and rows.

- Normal Flow refers to how Block and Inline elements are displayed on a page before any changes to their layout are made.

- The float property controls whether an element floats to the left, right, or not at all.

- Block-level elements begin on a new line

- Inline elements are on the same line

- <div> elements are often used to help group items together for stylizing in CSS.

- Normal Flow default layout of the page with each block-level element beginning on the next line.

- Relative Positioning moves an element from its normal flow position. This doesn’t affect any neighboring elements.

- Float: you can float elements to different parts of the webpage. Floated items need a width.

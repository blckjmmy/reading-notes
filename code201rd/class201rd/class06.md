# Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)
- A javaScript object is a stand-alone entity that can hold numerous values. A literal value is stored in an object property, while a function is represented by a method. Object literal or object constructor syntax can be used to build an object.

- Like a conventional array, the Object literal notation is just an array of key:value pairs with a colon separating the keys and values and a comma after each key:value pair except the last.

- Basically, constructor functions are just regular functions with a capital letter begining at the name. 

# Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242) 

- The Document Object Model (DOM) connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by expressing a document's structure, such as a web page's HTML.

HTML documents are represented as a tree structure, with each node representing a section of the document.
